## Overview

[Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) 
 (DDPM) by Jonathan Ho, Ajay Jain and Pieter Abbeel proposes the diffusion based model of the same name, but in the context of the ðŸ¤— Diffusers library, DDPM refers to the discrete denoising scheduler from the paper as well as the pipeline.

The abstract of the paper is the following:

We present high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On 256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN.
