# Installation

Install Diffusers for with PyTorch. Support for other libraries will come in the future

ðŸ¤— Diffusers is tested on Python 3.7+, and PyTorch 1.7.0+.

## Install with pip

You should install ðŸ¤— Diffusers in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, take a look at this [guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
A virtual environment makes it easier to manage different projects, and avoid compatibility issues between dependencies.

Start by creating a virtual environment in your project directory:

```bash
python -m venv .env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
```

Now you're ready to install ðŸ¤— Diffusers with the following command:

```bash
pip install diffusers
```

## Install from source

Install ðŸ¤— Diffusers from source with the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

This command installs the bleeding edge `main` version rather than the latest `stable` version.
The `main` version is useful for staying up-to-date with the latest developments.
For instance, if a bug has been fixed since the last official release but a new release hasn't been rolled out yet.
However, this means the `main` version may not always be stable.
We strive to keep the `main` version operational, and most issues are usually resolved within a few hours or a day.
If you run into a problem, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues) so we can fix it even sooner!

## Editable install

You will need an editable install if you'd like to:

* Use the `main` version of the source code.
* Contribute to ðŸ¤— Diffusers and need to test changes in the code.

Clone the repository and install ðŸ¤— Diffusers with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git
cd diffusers
pip install -e .
```

These commands will link the folder you cloned the repository to and your Python library paths.
Python will now look inside the folder you cloned to in addition to the normal library paths.
For example, if your Python packages are typically installed in `~/anaconda3/envs/main/lib/python3.7/site-packages/`, Python will also search the folder you cloned to: `~/diffusers/`.

<Tip warning={true}>

You must keep the `diffusers` folder if you want to keep using the library.

</Tip>

Now you can easily update your clone to the latest version of ðŸ¤— Diffusers with the following command:

```bash
cd ~/diffusers/
git pull
```

Your Python environment will find the `main` version of ðŸ¤— Diffusers on the next run.
