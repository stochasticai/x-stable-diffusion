ü§ó Diffusers provides pretrained diffusion models across multiple modalities, such as vision and audio, and serves
as a modular toolbox for inference and training of diffusion models.

More precisely, ü§ó Diffusers offers:

- State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines that can be run in inference with just a couple of lines of code (see [src/diffusers/pipelines](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/pipelines)). Check [this overview](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/README.md#pipelines-summary) to see all supported pipelines and their corresponding official papers.
- Various noise schedulers that can be used interchangeably for the preferred speed vs. quality trade-off in inference (see [src/diffusers/schedulers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/schedulers)).
- Multiple types of models, such as UNet, can be used as building blocks in an end-to-end diffusion system (see [src/diffusers/models](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/models)).
- Training examples to show how to train the most popular diffusion model tasks (see [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples), *e.g.* [unconditional-image-generation](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/unconditional_image_generation)).

## Quickstart

In order to get started, we recommend taking a look at two notebooks:

- The [Getting started with Diffusers](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/diffusers_intro.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/diffusers_intro.ipynb) notebook, which showcases an end-to-end example of usage for diffusion models, schedulers and pipelines.
  Take a look at this notebook to learn how to use the pipeline abstraction, which takes care of everything (model, scheduler, noise handling) for you, and also to understand each independent building block in the library.
- The [Training a diffusers model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/training_example.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/training_example.ipynb) notebook summarizes diffusion models training methods. This notebook takes a step-by-step approach to training your
  diffusion models on an image dataset, with explanatory graphics. 
  
## **New** Stable Diffusion is now fully compatible with `diffusers`!  

Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It's trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 10GB VRAM.
See the [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) for more information.

You need to accept the model license before downloading or using the Stable Diffusion weights. Please, visit the [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4), read the license and tick the checkbox if you agree. You have to be a registered user in ü§ó Hugging Face Hub, and you'll also need to use an access token for the code to work. For more information on access tokens, please refer to [this section](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) of the documentation.


### Text-to-Image generation with Stable Diffusion

```python
# make sure you're logged in with `huggingface-cli login`
from torch import autocast
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", use_auth_token=True)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
with autocast("cuda"):
    image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
```

**Note**: If you don't want to use the token, you can also simply download the model weights
(after having [accepted the license](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)) and pass
the path to the local folder to the `StableDiffusionPipeline`.

```
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4
```

Assuming the folder is stored locally under `./stable-diffusion-v1-4`, you can also run stable diffusion
without requiring an authentication token:

```python
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("./stable-diffusion-v1-4")
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
with autocast("cuda"):
    image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
```

If you are limited by GPU memory, you might want to consider using the model in `fp16` as 
well as chunking the attention computation.
The following snippet should result in less than 4GB VRAM.

```python
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", 
    revision="fp16", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    use_auth_token=True
)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
pipe.enable_attention_slicing()
with autocast("cuda"):
    image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
```

Finally, if you wish to use a different scheduler, you can simply instantiate
it before the pipeline and pass it to `from_pretrained`.
    
```python
from diffusers import LMSDiscreteScheduler

lms = LMSDiscreteScheduler(
    beta_start=0.00085, 
    beta_end=0.012, 
    beta_schedule="scaled_linear"
)

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", 
    revision="fp16", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    scheduler=lms,
    use_auth_token=True
)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
with autocast("cuda"):
    image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
    
image.save("astronaut_rides_horse.png")
```

### Image-to-Image text-guided generation with Stable Diffusion

The `StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline` lets you pass a text prompt and an initial image to condition the generation of new images.

```python
from torch import autocast
import requests
import torch
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

from diffusers import StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline

# load the pipeline
device = "cuda"
model_id_or_path = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"
pipe = StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_id_or_path,
    revision="fp16", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    use_auth_token=True
)
# or download via git clone https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4
# and pass `model_id_or_path="./stable-diffusion-v1-4"` without having to use `use_auth_token=True`.
pipe = pipe.to(device)

# let's download an initial image
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/main/assets/stable-samples/img2img/sketch-mountains-input.jpg"

response = requests.get(url)
init_image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert("RGB")
init_image = init_image.resize((768, 512))

prompt = "A fantasy landscape, trending on artstation"

with autocast("cuda"):
    images = pipe(prompt=prompt, init_image=init_image, strength=0.75, guidance_scale=7.5).images

images[0].save("fantasy_landscape.png")
```
You can also run this example on colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/image_2_image_using_diffusers.ipynb)

### In-painting using Stable Diffusion

The `StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline` lets you edit specific parts of an image by providing a mask and text prompt.

```python
from io import BytesIO

from torch import autocast
import torch
import requests
import PIL

from diffusers import StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline

def download_image(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return PIL.Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert("RGB")

img_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo.png"
mask_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo_mask.png"

init_image = download_image(img_url).resize((512, 512))
mask_image = download_image(mask_url).resize((512, 512))

device = "cuda"
model_id_or_path = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"
pipe = StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_id_or_path,
    revision="fp16", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    use_auth_token=True
)
# or download via git clone https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4
# and pass `model_id_or_path="./stable-diffusion-v1-4"` without having to use `use_auth_token=True`.
pipe = pipe.to(device)

prompt = "a cat sitting on a bench"
with autocast("cuda"):
    images = pipe(prompt=prompt, init_image=init_image, mask_image=mask_image, strength=0.75).images

images[0].save("cat_on_bench.png")
```

### Tweak prompts reusing seeds and latents

You can generate your own latents to reproduce results, or tweak your prompt on a specific result you liked. [This notebook](https://github.com/pcuenca/diffusers-examples/blob/main/notebooks/stable-diffusion-seeds.ipynb) shows how to do it step by step. You can also run it in Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pcuenca/diffusers-examples/blob/main/notebooks/stable-diffusion-seeds.ipynb).


For more details, check out [the Stable Diffusion notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_diffusion.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_diffusion.ipynb)
and have a look into the [release notes](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

## Philosophy

- Readability and clarity is preferred over highly optimized code. A strong importance is put on providing readable, intuitive and elementary code design. *E.g.*, the provided [schedulers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/schedulers) are separated from the provided [models](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/models) and provide well-commented code that can be read alongside the original paper.
- Diffusers is **modality independent** and focuses on providing pretrained models and tools to build systems that generate **continuous outputs**, *e.g.* vision and audio.
- Diffusion models and schedulers are provided as concise, elementary building blocks. In contrast, diffusion pipelines are a collection of end-to-end diffusion systems that can be used out-of-the-box, should stay as close as possible to their original implementation and can include components of another library, such as text-encoders. Examples for diffusion pipelines are [Glide](https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im) and [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion).

## In the works

For the first release, ü§ó Diffusers focuses on text-to-image diffusion techniques. However, diffusers can be used for much more than that! Over the upcoming releases, we'll be focusing on:

- Diffusers for audio
- Diffusers for reinforcement learning (initial work happening in https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/105).
- Diffusers for video generation
- Diffusers for molecule generation (initial work happening in https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/54)

A few pipeline components are already being worked on, namely:

- BDDMPipeline for spectrogram-to-sound vocoding
- GLIDEPipeline to support OpenAI's GLIDE model
- Grad-TTS for text to audio generation / conditional audio generation

We want diffusers to be a toolbox useful for diffusers models in general; if you find yourself limited in any way by the current API, or would like to see additional models, schedulers, or techniques, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues) mentioning what you would like to see.
