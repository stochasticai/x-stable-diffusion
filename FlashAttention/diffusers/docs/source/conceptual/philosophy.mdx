# Philosophy

- Readability and clarity are preferred over highly optimized code. A strong importance is put on providing readable, intuitive and elementary code design. *E.g.*, the provided [schedulers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/schedulers) are separated from the provided [models](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/models) and use well-commented code that can be read alongside the original paper.
- Diffusers is **modality independent** and focuses on providing pretrained models and tools to build systems that generate **continuous outputs**, *e.g.* vision and audio. This is one of the guiding goals even if the initial pipelines are devoted to vision tasks.
- Diffusion models and schedulers are provided as concise, elementary building blocks. In contrast, diffusion pipelines are a collection of end-to-end diffusion systems that can be used out-of-the-box, should stay as close as possible to their original implementations and can include components of other libraries, such as text encoders. Examples of diffusion pipelines are [Glide](https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im), [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) and [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/compvis/stable-diffusion).
